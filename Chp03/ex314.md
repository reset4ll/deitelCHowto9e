**3.14 Formulate a pseudocode algorithm for each of the following:**


*  a) Obtain two numbers from the keyboard, compute their sum and   display 
       the result.
*  b) Obtain two numbers from the keyboard, and determine and display
        which (if either) of the two numbers is the larger.
*  c) Obtain a series of positive numbers from the keyboard, and determine and
       display their sum. 
       Assume that the user types the sentinel value -1 to indicate 
       “end of data entry.”

***Pseudocode:***

	scanf(n1, n2);
	suma = n1 + n2;
    printf(suma);

	scanf(n1, n2);
      if( n1 > n2);
        mayor = n1;
           else
             mayor = n2;

	scanf(1,2....n)
    while(n != -1);
    suma = (1 + 2 + .... + n);
    printf(suma);
